# NumberCategorization_python
This Python project allows users to determine whether a number is even,odd, or a prime number. The program takes an integer input and displays categories that the number belongs to directly in the terminal. The project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as conditional statements, functions, user input handling, and algorithm optimization.
